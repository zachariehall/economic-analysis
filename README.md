# economic-analysis

Haven't done a whole lot yet. Just plotting some simple graphs of unemployment data and TSP historical share prices

To Run: 

1. Open the project
2. run source("./BLS_Data.R") to run the Bureau of Labor Statistics data file
3. run source("./TSP_Data.R") to run the TSP data file on the included csv
